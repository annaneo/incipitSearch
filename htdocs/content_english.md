## About IncipitSearch
IncipitSearch is a search engine for music-incipits. Incipts are a pragmatic approach for the cataloguing of notated music, in which a few bars of a score are transcribed. Concurrently, statements about the melodic characteristics of the music can occasionally be made on basis of these short fragments. Still, the IncipitSearch considers itself primarily as a counterpart to conventional thematic-bibliographical catalogues, as they have been presented in printed form for a long time. 
You can find a list of the repositories which are searchable with the IncipitSearch here. In the long run, the connection of further repositories can enable a comprehensive search for musical material from sources, catalogues and editions. 

## Search
The displayed keyboard enables you to enter search queries in the search field. 
Plaine & Easie Code is used as a standard syntax for the coding of the notes and can also be directly entered in the search field. Next to the found incipts, the result list also provides backlinks to the entries in the respective catalogue. 

## Materials and presentations

## Licence
IncipitSearch was developed at the Digital Academy of the Academy of Sciences and Literature | Mainz and is licenced under the MIT Licence.

## Repositories
Current repositories integrated in the IncipitSearch, ordered by time of integration. 

## Gluck-Gesamtausgabe
The digital, thematic-systematic register of all works of Christoph Willibald Gluck (GluckWV-online) is part of the Gluck-Gesamtausgabe (GGA) and draws upon the findings of the editorial-work and the decades of research of the project. The goal is the comprehensive and systematic listing of all compositions by Gluck in all their versions as well as the compilation of important data on the formation, the premier, the first edition, and the reception of individual works with the according references. 

## Catalogo del servizio bibliotecario nazionale
The Servizio Bibliotecario Nazionale (SBN) is the library network of the scientific libraries in Italy. The union catalogue OPAC SBN comprises entries to more than 15.000 musical sources. 

## Breitkopf catalogi delle Sinfonie
Next to further so-called thematic catalogues, the “Leipziger Musikverlagshaus Breitkopf” offered their goods for sale to music lovers by means of the Catalogi delle Sinfonie, which was published once a year. In these catalogues, the music that was available in print was recorded with regard to the composer and the line-up along with the musical incipit. The catalogues are available in the Bavarian State Library online as digital copies, but have not yet been processed in coded form. In the IncipitSearch, they are now for the first time processed in this way and digitally researchable for incipits. 


## Participation
Digital catalogues, editions, and all further forms of digital note-repositories, that provide their material in a standardised format, can be connected with the IncipitSearch. The content of the currently integrated repositories is obtained from RDF/XML, the IncipitSearch metadata format as well as from the HTML structure. If you want to integrate your repository in the IncipitSeatch, please contact us. 

## IncipitSearch metadata format (RDF)
The standard metadata format for the data exchange and the aggregation of data with the IncipitSearch uses the vocabulary of schema.org. There, Turtle is deployed as leading type of serialisation and JSON-LD as preferred type of embedding. The structure of the data is divided into the following levels: data sets consist of overall compositions, overall compositions consist of partial compositions, partial compositions have one or more incipits. 


## Legal notice 

Used software and standards 
The underlying software IncipitSearch was developed by Anna Neovesky and Gabriel Reimers from the Digital Academy at the Academy of Sciences and Literature | Mainz and is licenced under the MIT Licence. The virtual keyboard for the search entry is implemented through pianoKeyboard. For the display of the music-incipits, the IncipitSearch uses the Verovio JavaScript Toolkit. Verovio is developed by the Swiss RISM Office and is supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation. Verovio is licenced under the  LGPLv3 license. For the coding of the music-incipits the Plaine & Easie Code is used as standard syntax for the coding of the notes.
