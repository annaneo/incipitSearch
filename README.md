# IncipitSearch - Search engine for music incipits

IncipitSearch is a web platform and search engine for music incipits. The Beta version can be found [here](https://incipitsearch.adwmainz.net/) 

Incipits are an initial sequence of notes that represent the melodic characteristics of a composition.

Incipits are a pragmatic approach for the categorization of notated music, in which the first few bars of a score are transcribed. Furthermore, statements on melodic characteristics of the music can be made, based on these short fragments. First and foremost, the IncipitSearch can be seen as a counterpart to conventional thematic-bibliographic catalogues and catalogues of works, as they have been presented in printed form for a long time.

You can search the catalogues using the virtual keyboard. [Plaine & Easie Code](http://www.iaml.info/plaine-easie-code) is used as standard syntax for the encoding of the music incipits. The Plaine & Easie Code can be also entered directly in the search field.
